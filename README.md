# Bikeshare Case Study

This repository contains my analysis for one of the Google Data Analtics Course Capstone Projects on Coursera.
The goal of this project is to use  12 months of real data from Divvy to help a fictional company (Cyclistic)
decide on the best method(s) of converting casual riders using their service into annual members.

The analysis and graphs in this repository were made using RStudio,  whereas the mapping of longitude/latitude 
was created using Tableau.
